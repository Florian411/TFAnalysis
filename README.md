# TFAnalysis
This project contains our code used to generate the conference round submissions to the _ENCODE DREAM in vivo Transcription Factor Binding Site Prediction Challenge_.

##Required software
In order to operate our code on a linux system, the following software must be installed:
- [bedtools](https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2)
- R (minimum version 3.x.x)
- The _randomForest_ R-package
- Python (minimum version 2.7)
- [TEPIC](https://github.com/SchulzLab/TEPIC)
- [JAMM](https://github.com/mahmoudibrahim/JAMM/releases) version 1.0.7.2

Note that _TEPIC_ and _JAMM_ have additional dependencies. Links to the respective repositories are set up in this project.
